SimpleHomes is a stable base homes plugin. It offers all the essential features necessary in a homes plugin and some additional useful permissions. If you're looking for a more featured homes plugin with many more commands/permissions, then you'll want to take a look at UltimateHomes.

## Commands

There are only 5 commands in SimpleHomes.
- **/sethome [name]** - Set a new home at your current location.
- **/home [player|name] [name]** - Teleport to a certain home.
- **/homes [player]** - View a paginated list of homes.
- **/delhome [player|name] [name]** - Delete a certain home.
- **/simplehomes [help|reload]** - Get help or reload the plugin.

## Permissions

There are a number of permissions available to modify what certain players can do.

These are given to all players automatically, but can be negated with a permission manager such as [LuckPerms](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms):
- `simplehomes.sethome` - Allows players to set a home.
- `simplehomes.home` - Allows players to go to one of their homes.
- `simplehomes.homes` - Allows players to view a list of their homes.
- `simplehomes.delhome` - Allows players to delete one of their homes.
- `simplehomes.nether` - Allows players to set homes in the nether dimension.
- `simplehomes.end:` - Allows players to set homes in the end dimension.

## Support

If you need help with the plugin and can't find the answer here or on Spigot, then the best way to get help is to join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz). Make sure you read the frequently-asked channel before posting in the bug-reports channel (if it's a bug) or in the simple-homes channel (for general help).

If you have discovered a bug you can either join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz) and report it there or open an issue here on GitHub. Please do not message me on Spigot in regard to a bug, there are easier ways to communicate.


## Contributing

SimpleHomes is open-source and licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Majekdor/SimpleHomes/blob/main/LICENSE), so if you want to use any code contained in the plugin or clone the repository and make some changes, go ahead!

If you've found a bug within the plugin and would like to just make the changes to fix it yourself, you're free to do so and make a pull request here on GitHub. If you make significant contributions to the project, and by significant I mean one little PR to fix a tiny bug doesn't count as significant, you can earn the Contributor role in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz).
