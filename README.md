MajekHomes is a fully-featured homes plugin currently in development by Majekdor. The plugin has a few goals: be 
completely open source, make everything configurable, and have as many useful features as possible. I've been playing
Minecraft for almost a decade and have borrowed everything I liked from a ton of other homes plugins I've seen and
used during that time.

## Support

If you need help with the plugin and can't find the answer here, on the [wiki](https://github.com/Majekdor/MajekHomes/wiki), or on Spigot, then the best way to get help is to join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz). Make sure you read the frequently-asked channel before posting in the bug-reports channel (if it's a bug) or in the majek-homes channel (for general help).

If you have discovered a bug you can either join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz) and report it there or open an issue here on GitHub. Please do not message me on Spigot in regards to bugs, there are easier ways to communicate.


## Contributing

MajekHomes is open-source and licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Majekdor/MajekHomes/blob/main/LICENSE), so if you want to use any code contained in the plugin or clone the repository and make some changes, go ahead!

If you've found a bug within the plugin and would like to just make the changes to fix it yourself, you're free to do so and make a pull request here on GitHub. If you make significant contributions to the project, and by significant I mean one little PR to fix a tiny bug doesn't count as significant, you can earn the Contributor role in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz).


## Donate

I'm a full time college student who makes and supports these plugins in my free time (when I have any). As a long time supporter of open source, all of my plugins are free. If you enjoy my plugins and would like to support me, you can buy me coffee over on  [PayPal](https://paypal.com/paypalme/majekdor). Donations of any amount are appreciated and a donation of $10 or more will get you the Supporter role in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz)!
